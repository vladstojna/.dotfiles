# .dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles and configurations.

## Install

Copy the files to their corresponding directories. Add theme files to:

- `.config/rofi/theme.rasi`
- `.config/tmux/theme.tmux`

I did not distribute the themes due to license incompatibilities :( but I use
modified versions of
[spotlight.rasi](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection) and
[tokyonight_storm.tmux](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim).

Some configs may require the scripts from my
[collection](https://github.com/vladstojna/assorted-scripts) to be in PATH
without their file extensions to work:

- `.local/share/applications/rofi-manage-skyrimse-launch.desktop`
- `.config/dunst/dunstrc.d/play-sound.conf`
- bspwm configs
- sxhkd configs
